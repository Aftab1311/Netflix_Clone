# Netflix_Clone
A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include:

Hooks (and custom hooks)
React Router
Redux Toolkit
Context API
Responsive web design
Cypress end-to-end testing

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated.

The future of this project:

Integrate it with a Django backend
Create an authentication flow
Add REST API endpoints for every user-related event, such as adding Netflix profiles
Runing Project Locally
Install dependencies: run npm install in root project
Get API key from here
Create .env file in root project and add: API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
Run project: npm run dev or npm start

### Runing Project Locally

- Install dependencies: run `npm install` in root project
- Get API key from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- Create .env file in root project and add: `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- Run project: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
