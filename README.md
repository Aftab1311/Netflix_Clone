A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* Redux Toolkit 
* Context API 
* Responsive web design 
* Cypress end-to-end testing 

<br />

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the 
code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

* Integrate it with a Django backend
* Create an authentication flow
* Add REST API endpoints for every user-related event, such as adding Netflix profiles

### Runing Project Locally

- Install dependencies: run `npm install` in root project
- Get API key from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- Create .env file in root project and add: `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- Run project: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
